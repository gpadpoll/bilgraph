Unified Knowledge-Graph for Brazilian Indigenous Languages

## Abstract

An unified knowledge-graph for Brazilian indigenous languages (BIL). We present BILGraph, a prototype we built for Bororo and Tupian languages, such as Guajajara, Munduruku and Akuntsu. Here you will find the the knowledge extraction and entity linking process to build the graph from a dependency treebank and a lexical database for Tupian and Bororo languages.
